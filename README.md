# UNSW
This is where I put all my UNSW assignments

* COMP9319 = Web Data and Compression course. All 3 assignments were done in C++

* COMP9321 = Web Application Engineering course. This only has the first assignment which was just a basic web app that interfaced with XML data. The second assignment was a major group assignemnt and has its own repo (see COMP9321_Web_Apps repo).
